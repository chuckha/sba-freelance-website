# About

## What We Do

We create fine dining experiences, providing personable service, high attention to detail, and the added option of basic housekeeping to make your time with us stress-free. We're happy to work with you in the comfort of your own home or travel anywhere around the world to make your holiday that little bit more special.

We have over 30 years combined cooking experience, from commercial kitchens and front of house experience to high-end personal service, including 12 years as personal chef to the Duke and Duchess of Devonshire at Chatsworth House. We've catered for royalty and high-profile public figures, including the Queen herself, and worked alongside top chefs like Mary Berry. You can find us in print through our collaboration with Reflections Magazine and the recipes we've contributed to the Telegraph and Sarah Raven's book Good Good Food. If you're looking to be treated like a king (or queen) in your own home at a competitive price, you've come to the right place!

## How It Works
Our process is simple, taking all the hassle out of catering for events, holidays, or even simple dinner parties. Contact us and we'll work with you to find a price that suits your budget. After that, sit back and relax!

When we design your menu, you can tell us exactly what you want and we'll make it happen, or if you want some help we'll create proposed menus for you to select from. Once you've decided on the food, we'll arrive with everything we need and produce the menu to your exact specifications and dietary requirements, keeping it local and seasonal where required. If needed, we also provide housekeeping, driving, and any other service requirements you have to make the experience absolutely carefree for you and your guests.

During your event we bring the restaurant to you, providing table service and catering to your every need before disappearing into the night leaving no trace of our presence. As a finishing touch, you'll receive a convenient itemised invoice via email.

## Why Choose Us

Because we love what we do, the passion we share and the pride we show in every aspect of our work is unparalleled. With our extensive experience in all aspects of cooking and front of house in both commercial and private establishments, we have you covered for every occasion, and we pride ourselves on our personable service, which provides all the little things that matter as part of the bigger picture we'll help you create. We understand the need for privacy and guarantee a high level of discretion and confidentiality when working with all our clients and their guests.

If you are looking for fine dining for your home or holiday, look no further. Nothing is too big or too small for us, and we will cater to your every need with a smile.
