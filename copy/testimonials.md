# Testimonials

Sophie and Scott Burnside-Allen have been working for us from December 2017 till April 2018 in our chalet.

Their duties included looking after the house with all the housekeeping needed, cleaning, laundry, tidying up the sitting rooms, playrooms and ski room, setting the scene for drinks in the evenings with candles and the fires going, the house always had fresh flowers and looked perfect. Their forte is really in the cooking, as both are professional chefs of a very high standard: prepaid breakfasts, lunches, teas, cocktails, canapés and fabulous dinners. We always had home-made granolas for breakfasts, home-made breads and various cakes were always ready for us to snack on.

They ran the chalet -- that at times housed 16 people -- immaculately and always with a smile on their face, which for me is priceless. They are both extremely professional and know all the details on how to entertain in style. We are devastated they will not be able to be with us this ski season and I cannot recommend them highly enough.

I can assure you that food and hospitality has always been high on my agenda (as my waistband can verify) and I have been lucky enough to have sampled cooking of the highest order from around the world.

My party was lucky enough to have been looked after at a magnificent venue on the North Coast of Scotland for a week by Sophie and Scott and we were amazed at the high standard of cuisine for every meal and the use of fresh locally sourced produce.

All these culinary extravaganzas were served to us with a continued smile and a can-do attitude, which is essential when you are on a week's cherished holiday where food and wine is one of the central ingredients for success.

I highly recommend both Sophie and Scott as a brilliant team who will only impress and never disappoint.

Dear Scott & Sophie,

Just a quickie to THANK YOU both and to CONGRATULATE you most heartily on the DELICIOUS variety of treats you served at Bighouse. It was tough to leave yesterday (Friday) morning! 

The blow was softened by another of your yummy picnics, which made the drive to home near Perth a pleasure. In fact the chocolate cake was so gorgeous but filling that I have just finished the smaller half to crown my otherwise very simple bachelor supper at home!

I’d like to recommend Scott and Sophie to you - they have just catered for a large party of us in Scotland and during the week offered a consistently high standard of delicious food. 

The menu was varied and tasty even though the location was extremely remote and kitchen facilities limited. They were especially thoughtful towards special dietary requirements, which is a concern when planning entertaining for such a demanding and food aware audience as us!

Sophie and Scott have cooked for us a few times and I can thoroughly recommend them as chefs. They work very hard and have produced some exceptionally delicious food for our clients and guests who have been delighted with every beautiful plate put in front of them. Sophie and Scott are cheerful, utterly polite, discreet, and very accommodating of client dietary requests and requirements. They work very well with the existing house team and I will not hesitate to ask them to come and cook for us again. I highly recommend Sophie and Scott as personal chefs.

Sophie Burnside-Allen and Scott prepared and served outstanding food for my party of fishers in Scotland this summer. They did this with charm and were delightful to all our guests. I highly recommend them to all.

I am writing to say how lucky my husband and myself, together with a party of eight, were to experience the delicious culinary delights of Sophie and Scott whilst staying at The Bighouse, in Scotland last week.

The menus were planned so well and we were treated to the very best breakfasts with variations of cooked items, including Eggs Benedict, kippers, porridge and every conceivable way of cooking eggs, bacon, sausages etc. To start with fruit, yoghurt, cereal, including homemade granola, home made bread, homemade marmalade and jams. Plus homemade fresh fruit smoothies and beautifully presented fresh fruits! All of which were totally delicious.

We ate picnic lunches, all of which were imaginative, with wonderful quiches, colourful and beautifully presented sandwich type concoctions (home made bread again) to share and tear, salads, chicken with red pepper sauce, cheeses and cold meats, smoked salmon mousses, a variety of salamis and chorizo, to name just a few of the amazing dishes we were treated to each day.

Always a home made cake at tea time, then three courses for dinner with perfectly presented, balanced and delicious courses. The lobster with butter, herbs and garlic was exceptional. But so was everything else and both Sophie and Scott worked so hard to produce the excellent and imaginative menus. They were a delight to meet and chat with, nothing was too much trouble for them to do, and I will certainly be employing them to cook for us, as and when we have a special occasion.
