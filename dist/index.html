                    <p>We create fine dining experiences,
                    providing personable service, high attention to detail, and
                    the added option of basic housekeeping to make your time
                    with us stress-free. We're happy to work with you in the
                    comfort of your own home or travel anywhere around the world
                    to make your holiday that little bit more special.</p>

                    <p>We have over 30 years combined cooking experience, from
                    commercial kitchens and front of house experience to
                    high-end personal service, including 12 years as personal
                    chef to the Duke and Duchess of Devonshire at Chatsworth
                    House. We've catered for royalty and high-profile public
                    figures, including the Queen herself, and worked alongside
                    top chefs like Mary Berry. You can find us in print through
                    our collaboration with Reflections Magazine and the recipes
                    we've contributed to the Telegraph and Sarah Raven's book
                    Good Good Food. If you're looking to be treated like a king
                    (or queen) in your own home at a competitive price, you've
                    come to the right place!</p>

                    <h1 class="heading">how it works</h1>
                    <p>Our process is simple, taking all the
                    hassle out of catering for events, holidays, or even simple
                    dinner parties. Contact us and we'll work with you to find a
                    price that suits your budget. After that, sit back and
                    relax!</p>
                    <p>When we design your menu, you can tell us exactly what
                    you want and we'll make it happen, or if you want some help
                    we'll create proposed menus for you to select from. Once
                    you've decided on the food, we'll arrive with everything we
                    need and produce the menu to your exact specifications and
                    dietary requirements, keeping it local and seasonal where
                    required. If needed, we also provide housekeeping, driving,
                    and any other service requirements you have to make the
                    experience absolutely carefree for you and your guests.</p>
                    <p>During your event we bring the restaurant to you,
                    providing table service and catering to your every need
                    before disappearing into the night leaving no trace of our
                    presence. As a finishing touch, you'll receive a convenient
                    itemised invoice via email.</p>
